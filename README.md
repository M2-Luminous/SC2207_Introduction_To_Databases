1. For Lab 1, you are required to conceptually model a database application in the form of an ER diagram.  You need to determine what can or cannot be modeled in an ER diagram from the application description.  State assumptions whenever necessary.  More information in the lab manual.

2. In this lab, each team should finalize their database schema design based on the feedback received from their lab supervisor for their Lab 1 ER diagram and start to work on their Lab 3.
An ER digram for Lab 1 will be posted on the course site after the last lab group has submitted their reports.  Each team may base their schema design based on their own Lab 1 ER diagram or the one posted.
Please note that the 2nd laboratory session is a free access session; attendance is not mandatory.

3. Lab 3 requires you to convert the ER diagram for Lab 1 into relational schema and ensure that the relations are at least in 3NF.  Each team may base their schema design based on their own Lab 1 ER diagram or the one posted.  It is to demonstrate your understanding of the 3NF normalization process.  Attendance is mandatory.   

4. Lab 4 requires you to start programming your schema and queries into MS SQL Server available in the lab.  Do start this early as queries need to be ready by end of Lab 5.

5. Lab 5 requires you to have queries ready to answer the questions in Appendix B of the lab manual.  In addition, you need to demo and record your query in execution.
